              Um, well it's a delorean, right? Thank god I found you. Listen,
              can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a
              major breakthrough, I'll need your assis-tance. Right. Save the
              clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an
              initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning
              struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the
              Hill Valley Society think it should be preserved.
